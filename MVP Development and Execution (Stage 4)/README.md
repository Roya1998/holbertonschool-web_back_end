Progress Monitoring Approach

Although the project is developed by a single individual, agile monitoring practices are followed to maintain structure, accountability, and steady progress.


Daily Stand-Ups (Self-Check)

A short daily self-review is conducted to simulate a stand-up meeting, focusing on:
What was completed yesterday (e.g., product list screen implemented)
What will be worked on today (e.g., product detail page)
Any blockers or challenges (e.g., UI layout issues, data structure decisions)

\\\\
