Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a mobile beauty e-commerce application that allows users to easily browse, compare, and purchase makeup products in one place. The app aims to simplify the makeup shopping experience by providing clear product information, transparent pricing, and a user-friendly interface, similar to platforms like Temu or Trendyol but focused exclusively on cosmetics and beauty products.

Objectives:
Provide users with an intuitive and visually appealing interface to browse makeup products and view prices.
Enable users to easily compare products based on category, brand, and price to make informed purchasing decisions.
Create a scalable MVP that can be expanded with features such as reviews, favorites, and personalized recommendations.

Technical Skills Risk

One potential risk is that team members may lack sufficient experience with mobile app development or e-commerce technologies. This could slow down development or lead to technical mistakes. To reduce this risk, the team should schedule training sessions, use beginner-friendly tools and frameworks, and allow time in the early stages for learning and practice.

Schedule and Timeline Risk

Another risk is project delays caused by unexpected technical issues or poor time estimation. Delays can affect overall project delivery. This risk can be mitigated by creating a realistic project timeline, including buffer time for unforeseen problems, and conducting regular progress check-ins.

Budget Risk

Limited financial resources may restrict the ability to implement certain features or achieve high-quality design. To manage this risk, the project should prioritize essential features, avoid unnecessary functionality, and rely on free or open-source tools when possible.

Performance Risk

The application may experience performance problems such as slow loading times or crashes, especially as the number of users grows. This risk can be minimized by optimizing the code, performing regular testing, and keeping the app lightweight by focusing only on core features.

Security Risk

There is a risk of security vulnerabilities that could expose user data or payment information. To mitigate this risk, the project should implement basic security practices such as secure login systems, encrypted data storage, and safe payment integration methods.

User Experience Risk

The app may fail to meet user expectations if the design is confusing or not visually appealing. This risk can be reduced by conducting usability testing, gathering user feedback, and making design improvements based on real user needs.


Stage 1: Idea Development (Completed)

During this stage, the project idea was generated and refined. The concept of a beauty-focused e-commerce application, similar to Temu or Trendyol, was defined. The target users, basic features, and overall purpose of the app were identified.
Key Deliverable: Finalized project idea and concept approval.

Stage 2: Project Charter Development (Current)

In this stage, the project scope, objectives, risks, and high-level plan are documented. This includes defining what is in-scope and out-of-scope, identifying potential risks, and establishing a basic timeline.
Key Deliverable: Approved project charter document.

Stage 3: Technical Documentation

This stage focuses on preparing the technical foundation of the project. System requirements, user stories, basic architecture, and design wireframes are created. These documents guide the development process.
Key Deliverables: Technical requirements document and basic UI/UX designs.

Stage 4: MVP Development

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the app is developed in this stage. Core features such as product listings, pricing, shopping cart, and checkout are implemented. Testing is conducted to ensure basic functionality and usability.
Key Deliverables: Functional MVP of the beauty e-commerce app.

Stage 5: Project Closure

The final stage involves reviewing the completed project, fixing any remaining issues, and preparing final documentation or presentations. The project outcomes are evaluated against the original objectives.
Key Deliverables: Final project report and presentation.
