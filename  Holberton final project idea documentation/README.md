Overview of the Idea Development Process

This project will be developed by a single person and followed a structured idea development process. The process will include initial research, brainstorming, evaluation of multiple ideas, and final selection of an MVP concept. The goal is to create a mobile application in the beauty and cosmetics field that solves a real user problem while remaining feasible to implement as an individual project.


The development process consists of:
Research and ideation
Evaluation of multiple app concepts
Selection and refinement of the final MVP
Documentation of decisions 

During the ideation phase, several mobile app ideas related to cosmetics and beauty were explored.

Strengths:
High user interest
Easy to understand
Community-driven

Weaknesses:
Very competitive market
Requires a large user base to be valuable

Reasons for Rejection:
The market is already dominated by well-established platforms with strong brand recognition.
As a solo developer, attracting and retaining a critical mass of users would be challenging.
Without a large community, the app would provide limited value to users.
Monetization would be difficult at the MVP stage due to strong competition.
